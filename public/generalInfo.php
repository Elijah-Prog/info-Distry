                Chapter 1 As children we long to grow up 
                and become independent, do whatever we want, 
                whenever we want with whoever we want. But never 
                look at the responsibilities that come with being a 
                grown-up. I know cliché isn’t it? But it is the blunt 
                truth that many don’t want to admit. Now let me tell 
                you about a man that chose not to grow up, yes a man 
                that never grew up. We all hit a certain age where we 
                want to explore, show our deepest and even darkest desires, 
                full fill our egos with whatever bullshit we choose to believe in. 
                I say bullshit because to be honest some peoples beliefs are literal 
                crap, but that’s not the point of whatever this is. Now a wise man once 
                said, “The opposite of growth is loath”. I don’t know who the wise 
                man was but he said it. I’m sure a lot of you are asking yourselves 
                “What does he mean?”, well if you have a literal mind you will know 
                exactly what he meant. But for those with no imagination, do your own 
                research.

                }
                echo dateUpdated($currentDate);
